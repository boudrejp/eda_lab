# eda_lab
Collaborative work for W203 Lab 1 for exploratory data analysis


### Main research question

* Approach- explore the data to then find the main research question
  * Then figure out smaller subquestions to also build into this
  
 * By Saturday, come up with recommendations of larger picture
 * In meantime, each writes up individual subsections
  * We will filter for not having overlapping topics
